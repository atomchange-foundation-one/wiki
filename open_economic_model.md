# Open Economic Model

## Empowering You
Community members have real power

1 token = 1 vote power

Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus

Community elects number of delegates, who in turn runs efficient decentralized network

Delegates can be added/revoked by a community at any time

Delegates receives decent fixed salary (newly issued coins) set by a community

Community can change the rules

Community can change consensus model

And… Community can issue new tokens

Stop. What?

## Problems with existing solutions
Old System:
* Not Transparent, not controllable by public
* Still doing some welfare efforts (government -> taxes -> social welfare projects)

Existing Blockchain Networks
* Transparent 
* Controllable by public
* Not set up for general-welfare projects

## What if?
I want to do some project, that will benefit all token holders (community)?
* Develop new opensource wallet for the community?
* Build roads in the community?

How do I get money?

## Compaing Ways of funding
ICO/Separate funding campaign -> effectively creates new community

Emission (essentially equals to taxes) -> all community members pay

## Decision making, simple
Project submits proposal

Community votes

Project gets funded

All community members (token holders get deluded little bit)

## Decision making, advanced
What if community grows too big? 

Decision making process is not efficient

Too many scam projects will be submitted

Low voting participation

Low average qualification of the community

## Guardian Boards
Community can elect Guardian Boards

Guardian Boards can be multi-level or segmented by expertise

Project submits proposal 

Guardian Board approves/bans project (filtering bad ones)

Community votes on approved project

Project gets funded

## Community Activists
Voting power of an account can be trusted to another one

Active voting can be stimulated with small rewards

Missed voting can be punished with small tax, thus stimulating token holders either actively vote or delegate their voting power

Community Activists subgroup emerges out of the community (more qualified community members who regularly vote on projects, pursuing general well-being)

Community Activists can share part of voting reward to voting power owner

## Declaration of Values
Community have declaration of values

Projects have to comply with the declaration

Open and transparent: projects should have completely transparent and public operations

Neutral and do-good: should not discriminate members of community and should bring benefit for all community members

Have ‘Community Project’ legal properties

## Legal properties
Cannot spend received funds on anything beyond stated mission

Should be legally or technically (smart contract) obliged to utilize funds in way stated to community during voting

Managers can define their compensation before putting the project on voting

## Non-profit projects
Can be non-profit:
* Dispatches funds into non-refundable community-welfare project

Examples: 
* Deploying cross-continental data cable
* Promoting token of the community and expanding community
* Building roads in the community
* Further development of the blockchain
* Building free hospital in the community

## For-profit projects
Community dividends:

Burning community tokens essentially equals to paying out dividends to all community members

If the for-profit community-funded project eventually in due course of its economic activity burns more tokens, than was issued to it, the project increases general welfare

Can have legally or technically (smart contract) defined % reward for project managers

## Implications/assumptions
No such models exists on any viable scale

DAOs based on Open Economic model can scale and grow faster than other types of DAOs

Wealth distribution will become much more smooth than with current models

Society will become more open, transparent and responsible

Open Economic Model can supply social welfare needs and deploy general well-being in much more efficient way, than existing government-tax model 

Open Economic model can, and probably will replace state-centric society organization
