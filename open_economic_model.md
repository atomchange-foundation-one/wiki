# Open Economic Model

## Empowering You
* Community members have real power
* 1 token = 1 vote power
* Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus
* Community elects number of delegates, who in turn runs efficient decentralized network
* Delegates can be added/revoked by a community at any time
* Delegates receives decent fixed payment (newly issued coins) set by a community
* Community can change the rules
* Community can change consensus model
* Andâ€¦ Community can issue new tokens

Stop. What?

## Problems with existing solutions
Old System:
* Not Transparent, not controllable
* Still doing some welfare efforts (government -> taxes -> social welfare projects)

Existing Blockchain Networks
* Transparent 
* Controllable
* Not set up for general-welfare projects

## What if?
I want to do some project, that will benefit all token holders (community)?
* Deploy new high-bandwidth cable?
* Repair Tower Bridge?

How do I get money?

## Ways of funding
* ICO/Separate funding campaign -> effectively creates new community
* Emission (essentially equals to taxes) -> all community members pay

## Decision making, simple
Project submits proposal

Community votes

Project gets funded

All community members (token holders get deluded little bit)
