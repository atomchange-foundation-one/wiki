# Multiblockchain interaction platform

We believe blockchain ecosystem have a unavoidable need for multiblockchain interaction platforms in order to make a next step and the development of the industry.

At he moment there are tens of very advanced distributed blockchain platforms but there is no way to interact for them except through centralized platforms.

All the centralized exchanges bears full pack of respective risks and inconvenience connected with central point of attack and control.

Our goal is to make an open, easily extandable platform and standard for multiblockchain interaction. We do not want to work several years on something that will turn out impractical. We want to implement the system step by step in short milestones that would be usable by community by themselves. 

## Exchange

First and most important use case of multiblockchain interaction is a token exchange.

Considering iterative approach, the first sevaral milestones would be:
1. DFR to BTC token exchange
2. DFR to ETH exchange
3. BTC to ETH exchange
4. Add more pairs

In this list there is 2 families of blockchains mentioned: bitcoin-based and ethereum-based.

Both of these families will require slightly different approach but in both cases secure decentralized exchange can be implemented.
