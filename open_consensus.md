# Open Consensus

## Motivation and preface
Our aim is to create a decentralized community platform governed by the community.
First of all, community be ultimate source of descisions regarding how platform functions. 
In order to do this, community should be able to change also the rules how descisions is made in the community also. 
In all existing decentralized systems, end users or community members are already in some sense descision makers in a sense that they choose what platform to use, and if no one uses the platform, it dies. 
With the development of public blockchains, such events as forks came onto the scene. 
Eventually, fork is an event, when some part of the community does not agrees with another part of the community and decides to go on their own way. In blockchain universe, such events can be easily handled. 
We do not see forks as an issue. Diversity is prerequirement for the freedom of choice, the basic human right. 
Diversity creates problems only if there is an isolation. If there is free interaction between multiple platforms, open flow of ideas and values, diversity actually increases general well-being by offering more choice.
Therefore we are building this platform. 

## Basic consensus
The version of the platform end users accessing depends on a which version signing nodes (full nodes) running. 
But ultimately if the platform have too many nodes in brings a lot of issues related to speed and syncronization.

We belive that Delegated Proof of Stake system is the optimal solution, existing and tested today. 

Delegated Proof of Stake means all tokenholders can vote and elect nodes who is in their turn, responsible for the running full nodes with proper version of the software. 

## 1. System Launch
Initial 21 full node runners download the software and join the network. They get 10 tokens per mined block.
