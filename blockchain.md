# FreeTeal Blockchain

## Concept

FreeTeal Blockchain should be DPoS blockchain. 

First of all, DPoS blockchain leaves ultimate power in the hands of community. 

And second, DPoS consensus model allows to have fast enough platform due to limited amount of supporting nodes. 

Each signing node is elected by token holders and receives fixed 'salary' in form of tokens set up for the supporting nodes.

Blockchain keeps:
1. FTT balance and transaction records
2. Voting records
3. Governance rules
4. Reputation scores
5. Orderbook
6. Trade history with links to transactions on other chains. 
7. Other custom and user-deployed smart contracts
